# invoice
i am tired of invoicing SAAS that want me to pay them money each month. that's why i'm writing my own tool, just for my specific needs. it could be useful for other people at some point.

it's python again and will feature multiple export formats and overall json configurability.

i also take this project as an opportunity to check out http://mypy-lang.org/ .. feels pretty great so far.
